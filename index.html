  <h1>Zebra Forms</h1>
  <p>Zebras are really interesting animals are really interesting animals from Africa</p>
  <p>Zebras are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: Gr√©vy's zebra, the plains zebra, and the mountain zebra. Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae </p>
  <p>Marty, from the hit movie, "Madagascar" is a zebra who is voiced by Chris Rock. I personally think he is a more interesting and especially funnier than Alex, the main character. He has an identity crisis in the second movie which I relate to persnonally. I think about his quote expressing his anxiety for wondering if he is a zebra with white stripes or black stripes atleast once a week, not sure why. </p>
